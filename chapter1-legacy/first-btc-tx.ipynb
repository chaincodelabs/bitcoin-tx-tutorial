    "## Introduction\n",
    "Transactions are perhaps the most important part of the bitcoin protocol. All the other aspects of the bitcoin protocol ultimately serve to verify, secure, and agree upon the order of bitcoin transactions. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first bitcoin transactions created by Satoshi are very different to the typical bitcoin transactions you see on the blockchain today. Over the years there have been a number of upgrades to the bitcoin protocol that have resolved issues such as transaction malleability, and introduced new features such as timelocks and schnorr signatures. \n",
    "\n",
    "To understand how various types of bitcoin transactions work, it's helpful to understand how the earliest transaction types worked, and how new features got introduced. Taken at face value, the protocol can seem strangely written. The design makes more sense when appreciating that all upgrades have used softforks to enable backwards compatibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this view in mind, we'll start by looking at the very first transaction types, then work our way chronologically through the various upgrades to arrive at the latest transaction types and features used today. "

    "Legacy bitcoin transactions have four main components: the version, inputs, outputs, and locktime. To illustrate each of these fields and what they do, we'll go through an example using the first ever bitcoin transaction.

Since our transaction was a legacy transaction, every byte counts as 4 weight units, making the total weight of the transaction the `size*4`.

    "## Things that have changed\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the years a number of upgrades and improvements have been made to the bitcoin protocol, allowing for more sophisticated transactions and user friendliness. Below is a preview of some of the main changes that we'll cover in later chapters.\n",
    "\n",
    "- pubkeys - This first ever transaction used an uncompressed 65-byte pubkey. These days 33-byte compressed pubkeys are more common, and for taproot we use 32-byte pubkeys.   \n",
    "- P2PK - The output of this transaction was a 'Pay to Pubkey' which is generally considered obsolete. The standard transaction outputs types involve either paying to a public key hash, a script hash, or a taproot pubkey.\n",
    "- Addresses - The newer standard transaction types have conventions for converting the scriptPubkey into a human readable address. This makes the process of sending and receiving bitcoins more user friendly and less vulnerable to errors.\n",
    "- Script OP_CODES - New script OP_CODES allow for more sophisticated logic in how bitcoin transactions can be locked up/spent.\n",
    "- Segwit - Since segwit, a new witness field was introduced. \n",
    "- Taproot - taproot introduced schnorr signatures, providing a host of privacy and scaling benefits."

    "## Coinbase transactions\n",
    "\n",
    "All bitcoins originate from coinbase transactions. Coinbase transactions are the first transaction in every block. The output spends up to the total of the block subsidy and the total of all transaction fees included in the block. As well as being the first transaction in a block, coinbase transactions are unique in that the single 'input' field consists of all zeros.\n",
