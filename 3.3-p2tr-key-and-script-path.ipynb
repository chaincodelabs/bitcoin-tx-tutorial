    "## Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "Patricia is a mother of three kids, Adam, Ben, Carla, all in their 20s attending college. She's planning to go backpacking in the countryside where she won't have access to the internet. She decides she wants to put away some funds that her kids could use in an emergency if any of them ever needed money while she was away. She's happy to let any of the kids spend the funds under any condition. Ideally she wants her transaction to be as private as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: What options does she have?\n",
    "\n",
    "She could simply give all three of her kids the private key to a utxo/wallet, but she knows it's not the best security practice to distribute secret information like that. She also wants it to be provable who spent the in the case it does get spent. Before taproot, she probably would have been best off creating a P2WSH transaction where the script allowed any of the children's private keys to spend the output. Now that taproot transactions are supported, she can create an address that commits to a taptree, where each leaf of the taptree commits to each of the children's public keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to P2WSH, this transaction will be more private. Patricia can retain the ability to spend the funds using the internal public key and never reveal that it committed to a script. Alternatively, if one of the children spends the output, only their public key gets revealed. "

    "1. For taproot inputs, the opcodes`OP_CHECKSIG` and `OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY` are used to verify Schnorr signatures rather than ECDSA signatures.\n",
    "2. A tagged hash is a hash that includes an additional piece of information called a \"tag\" in addition to the regular data being hashed. An advantage of using tagged hashes is that it ensures the hash can only be used in the way it was intended by the creator. For example, in a tap tree, the \"TapLeaf\" and \"TapBranch\" tags prevent a hash for a branch being interpreted as a leaf.\n",
