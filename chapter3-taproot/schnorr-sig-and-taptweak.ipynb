    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have heard that taproot introduced schnorr signatures, and that taproot signatures have a linear property, but what does this mean? In this section we'll cover some basics of schnorr signatures, and how commitments can be encoded into public keys via taptweaks. By the end of this section you should understand the advantages of schnorr signatures over ECDSA signatures, and how to tweak public and private keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Since schnorr signatures were only recently introduced in bitcoin in taproot, you may think schnorr signatures were developed after ECDSA signatures, but you'd be wrong. Rajarshi Maitra puts it well in his blog post = [What the heck is Schnorr]((https://medium.com/bitbees/what-the-heck-is-schnorr-52ef5dba289f)\n",
    "\n",
    "> Schnorr signature was invented by Claus-Peter Schnorr back in the 1980s. His digital signature implementation was much simpler than contemporary other algorithms. But he did the worst thing that can ever happen to any kind of knowledge. He patented it before he published the paper. Because of his patent, the Schnorr signature algorithm did not see any widespread use for decades. In fact, ECDSAâ€™s predecessor, DSA was created specifically to bypass the Schnorr patent.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the ways ECDSA was designed to bypass the Schnorr patent was to break the useful linearity of Schnorr signatures. For this reason the math behind Schnorr signatures is also perhaps more intuitive than ECDSA. \n",
    "\n",
    "Elliptic curve private keys have a linear property, such that the sum of private keys will produce a sum of public keys equal to the sum of the individiual public keys. For a review of this principle, refer to the section '[Elliptic Curve Math Review](https://github.com/DariusParvin/bitcoin-tx-tutorial/blob/main/elliptic_curve_math_review.ipynb)'. With Schnorr signatures, this linearity extends to the signatures themselves. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Schnorr Signatures\n",
    "\n",
    "### x-only pubkeys\n",
    "\n",
    "Taproot uses a new pubkey format known as 'x-only pubkeys' as they contain only the x-coordinate of the public key point. Note that the public key point will always be interpreted as having an even y-coordinate. This means if the secret key produces a public key with an odd y-coordinate, the secret key and public key will need to be negated. For more on this see the 'x-only pubkey' section in the Elliptic Curve Math Review. Below we'll use the reference code from BIP340 for generating the pubkey from the secret key."
