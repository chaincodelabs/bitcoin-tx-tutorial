By including the amount in the sighash, the signer can be sure that the input amount is what they specified. If the amount did not match, then the signature would be invalid. This makes it easier for the offline signer to know how much is being spent and how much the transaction is paying in miner fees.\n",
    "3. Since the introduction of segwit, blocks are limited by 'weight units' rather than raw bytes. Each byte in the witness field counts for 1 weight unit, and bytes in the other fields count for 4 weight units. The relative discount for bytes in the witness field is what makes segwit inputs cheaper to spend from. See [BIP141](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki)."
