Kim would rather wait until Peter turns 18 before he's able to spend his bitcoin. Kim doesn't know how much longer she'll be around for, and she doesn't trust anyone else to handle her money. To give Peter bitcoin in a way which will only allow him to spend it once he's 18, Kim will do this by giving Peter a signed transaction for 0.1 btc with an absolute timelock set to expire on his 18th birthday.\n",

    "\n",
    "Relative timelocks allow the user to set a delay from when the input was confirmed. Note that this means each input has it's own `nSequence` field which must be satisfied for the transaction to be considered 'final'.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the scenario we just covered, Kim could have achieved the same outcome but using a relative timelock instead. The only difference would be that the delay would be specified relative to when the input was confirmed, rather than the absolute block height. Note however, that if anything happens to Kim's input (e.g. a reorg changes the block height of the input), this would affect the transaction using `nSequence`, but not the one using `nLocktime`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that `version` must be set to **`2`** for relative timelocks to be enabled.\n",

    "### Exercise\n",
    "Repeat the scenario above, but setting `nLocktime` to 0 instead, and relying on `nSequence`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: the block chain starts off at block 102, so the relative timelock should be set to 398 blocks for the transaction to be broadcastable at block 500.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint 2: nSequence is a 32 bit unsigned integer, so you can use the same `.to_bytes` method used to convert `locktime_int` to `locktime` in the previous example.\n",

    "- 1. nLocktime would not have been enforced, meaning Peter would have been able to broadcast the transaction immediately.\n",
    "- 2. No. Kim may create a new transaction that spends the input before Peter has a chance to broadcast his transaction.\n",
    "- 3. Version 1 transactions do not enforce relative timelocks. The node would therefore ignore the relative timelock and allow it to be broadcast.\n",
