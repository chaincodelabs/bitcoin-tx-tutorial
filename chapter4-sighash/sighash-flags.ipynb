    "- Raghav Sood has an excellent [blog](https://raghavsood.com/blog/2018/06/10/bitcoin-signature-types-sighash) covering the different sighash flags, their explanations and some examples of how they might be used.\n",
    "- Note that taproot defines a [new sighash](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0341.mediawiki#common-signature-message) `SIGHASH_DEFAULT` (`0x00`). This sighash flag signs over the whole transaction as with `SIGHASH_ALL`, the only difference is that the sighash is not appended to the signature in the transaction, saving a byte."

    "## Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem\n",
    "Jose is running a restaurant in El Salvador where most customers pay in bitcoin over the lightning network. He uses a hot wallet for his day to day business expenses, and a cold wallet for storing longer term savings. The signing device for his cold wallet is stored in a safe in his home town that he visits twice a year. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's Christmas and Jose is visiting home. He reflects on the past year of business and decides to relocate his restaurant to a larger location that an serve more customers. He knows he'll need to move some funds out of his cold storage but he'll have to go back to his restaurant before he figures out who he'll pay for the contract. The problem he faces is that he'd like to use the funds from his cold wallet a few weeks in the future when he's back at his restaurant, but it's only convenient for him to spend from it while he's at home with the offline signer.\n",
    "\n",
    "He could create a transaction to transfer funds to his hot wallet, but he feels uncomfortable with relying on the hot wallet for storing larger amounts of bitcoin. What other option does Jose have?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution\n",
    "To solve this problem, uses a two step solution using a transaction that spends one input from his cold wallet (then amount he wants to transfer), and a second input from his hot wallet.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first step, while he is at home with his offline signer, he creates a partially signed transaction that spends from a large UTXOs from his cold wallet and a small UTXO from his hot wallet. He only creates a signature to spend the large input from the cold wallet, leaving the other input to sign later. Importantly, he uses the `SIGHASH_NONE` sighash flag as it does not commit to any outputs, meaning he can set it to contractor's address later. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the second step, after he has figured out who he will pay for the contract, he creates the rest of the transaction by filling in the outputs, and creating a signature on the second input. For the second input he creates a signature using the `SIGHASH_ALL` flag, committing to all the outputs"

    "1. In this example, if Jose accidentally leaked his partially signed transaction after step 1, what would prevent someone else from using that signature signed with the `SIGHASH_NONE` flag (`cold_signature`) from adding it to their own transaction?  \n",
    "2. If Jose suspected that an attacker had compromised his lightning wallet private keys, could he safely attempt to broadcast the same transaction (`signed_tx`) anyway?\n",
    "3. If Jose knew the amount he was going to pay the contractor, but not their address, what sighash flag could he use to constrain the final transaction further. What advantage if any might this have?"

    "\n",
    "1. The signature still signs over all the inputs. It would only ever be valid in a transaction that spent the same set of input UTXOs, so that spender would need knowledge of the first UTXO's private key.\n",
    "2. No. If someone knew the lightning wallet's private key, they would be able to view the transaction once it was broadcasted, then create another signed transaction sending the total amount to themselves. Note that not opting in to rbf may help prevent an attacker from spending from the same input once the initial transaction has been broadcast, but it is not a guarantee.\n",
    "3. He could use `SIGHASH_SINGLE` and sign over just the change output. It would help avoid losing all his funds in a worst case scenario where an attacker knew his lighting wallet private keys (as in Q2)."
