    "## Introduction\n",
    "Bitcoin transactions that require signatures are signed over the signature hash. The sighash is a hash over all the parts of transaction that the signer wants their signature to commit to. For example a signature might commit to one or all of the inputs, and one or all of the outputs. The logic is that you concatenate all parts of the transaction you want to commit to and then hash them using a double sha256 hash. If the value of any of those items is changed (by an additional signer, miner, etc.) your signature will not verify as valid against the selected sighash parameters denoted by the sighash flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "From legacy, to segwitv0, to taproot, the computation of the sighash has changed along the way. These changes have been designed to make practical applications easier to perform. For example, in segwit v0, the input amount needed to be included in the inputs being signed over. This makes it easier for a signer to be sure what inputs it's signing over, rather than having to check against the blockchain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other improvements have improved the efficiency of signing. For example, in taproot transactions many of the intermediate hashes can be reused across different inputs. In this section we'll look in detail about how the sighash computation has evolved."

    "\n",
    "1 - For the verification of each signature, the amount of data hashing is proportional to the size of the transaction. As you can see from the example above, the whole transaction is signed over. Let's say the transaction had 100 p2pkh inputs. Not only does it make the transaction become large due to the number of inputs, but since each signature will require the hashing the transaction using the algorithm above, the amount of hashed data grows in O(n<sup>2</sup>).\n",
    "\n",
    "2 - This is usually not a problem for online network nodes as they could request for the specified transaction to acquire the output value. For an offline transaction signing device (\"cold wallet\"), however, the unknowing of input amount makes it impossible to calculate the exact amount being spent and the transaction fee. To cope with this problem a cold wallet must also acquire the full transaction being spent, which could be a big obstacle in the implementation of lightweight, air-gapped wallet. By including the input value of part of the transaction digest, a cold wallet may safely sign a transaction by learning the value from an untrusted source. In the case that a wrong value is provided and signed, the signature would be invalid and no funding might be lost."

In this situation the offline signer wouldn't have enough information to verify what the unspent paths were. \n",
